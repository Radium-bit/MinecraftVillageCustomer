# Minecraft Villager Trade Command Generator

---

## Introduction

This is a GUI tool developed based on Python Tkinter, designed for **Minecraft** players to quickly generate custom villager trade commands. It supports
 configuring villager names, professions, and trade items (emeralds for 
items / items for emeralds), and provides features like trade 
configuration saving/loading, batch reversal, and sorting. Finally, it 
outputs a standard `/data modify` command that complies with Minecraft syntax, eliminating the need to manually write complex NBT tags.

This software is open-source under the **GPL-V3 License**, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute it freely.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

1. Accurate Item IDs: For custom mod items (e.g., `kaleidoscope_cookery:iron_kitchen_knife`),
   ensure the corresponding mod is loaded in the game‚Äîotherwise, the 
   villager may not display trades correctly after the command takes 
   effect.
2. Right-Click Edit Limit: Only single trades can be edited via 
   right-click; the "Edit" option does not appear for multi-selections.
3. JSON Compatibility: Loaded JSON files must follow the tool's specified format (including `villager_name`, `profession`, and `trades` fields)‚Äîotherwise, a load failure prompt will appear.
